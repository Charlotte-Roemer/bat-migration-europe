Recordings of bat echolocation calls are easy to collect
- Material is cheaper and cheaper
- Setting up a passive recorder in the field is quick and easy
- Data process can be automated
- The process is not intrusive (no need to capture or disturb bats)

Acoustic recordings provide quality data to model spatial distribution
- Can provide true absence data for most species
- The number of bat passes/night is a proxy for population densities, which is much better than presence/absence data
