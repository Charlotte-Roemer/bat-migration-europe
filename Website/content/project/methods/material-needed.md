Data
- Full-night and full-spectrum recordings
- .wav files OR acoustic parameters provided by the TADARIDA software (.ta files)

Metadata required
- Detector type and settings
- Coordinates
- Date
- Type of study (ground-level, wind turbine, wind mast, buildingâ€¦)

Data filtering
- Poor-quality microphones
- Roost surveys
- Partial night recordings
