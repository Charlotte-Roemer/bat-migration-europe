The collection of data will demand efforts from partners and from the coordination team. These data are complex (multiple metadata to take into account), heavy (especially the sound files) and numerous. This is why a Data Management Plan was written to ensure that data management will follow the most up-to-date practices and international recommendations. This will also guarantee that these data are handled in a foreseeable and secure way.
