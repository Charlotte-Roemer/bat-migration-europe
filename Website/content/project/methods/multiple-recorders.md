- This project opens the opportunity to review the most common uses of settings and machines in Europe.

- This review will allow to define which possibilities exist to work on a common dataset, using for example:
    * Field tests to define which settings/machines give similar results
    * Larger time interval to count bat passes (e.g. positive minute of activity, Miller 2001, Haquart 2012) --> eliminates a lot of variability due to material used
    * Use setting and machine as input in models to take the variability into account
