- The policy of a single country is not sufficient to efficiently protect migrating bats, and this is why the [UNEP/EUROBATS agreement](https://www.eurobats.org/) was written and signed.

- Many of us collect data on bats all around Europe. This represents a huge database if brought together!

- A scientific collaboration can also include countries who did not sign EUROBATS.
