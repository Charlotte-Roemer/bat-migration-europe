The three most common migrating bats in geographical Europe will be studied:
- The [noctule bat *Nyctalus noctula*](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/14920/22015682#geographic-range)
- The [lesser noctule bat *Nyctalus leisleri*](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/14919/22016159)
- The [Nathusius pipistrelle *Pipistrellus nathusii*](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/17316/22132621)

For the moment, in order to focus the work effort, no other species will be studied. However, it could be possible, as a perspective, to extend this project to other species quite easily.
