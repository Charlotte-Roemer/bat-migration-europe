Bats take a high toll at wind turbines because of collisions and barotrauma at blades. 
- For instance, *N. noctula* has a high susceptibility to wind turbine collisions (flies high and migrates)
- [*Lasiurus cinereus* could go extinct](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320716310485) because of wind turbines. It shares biological traits with *N. noctula*.
- A large decline for *N. noctula* was [documented in France (2006-2019)](https://croemer3.wixsite.com/teamchiro/population-trends).
- It is thus urgent to reduce all impacts, including wind turbines.
