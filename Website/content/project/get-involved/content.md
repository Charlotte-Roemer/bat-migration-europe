If you are interested in the project, please subscribe to the newsletter [here]({{< ref "/newsletter" >}} "Newsletter").

We are still in the process of choosing space on servers for data exchange and organising the workflow of data.

In the meantime, please review the data that you would be willing to share for the project and list study sites using the table that you can [download here]("https://b2drop.eudat.eu/s/oYAbHRd33pNebS6"). You will find the definition and how to fill columns in [the 'definition' table here]("https://b2drop.eudat.eu/s/Ey3TbBemNCS6QFS"). 
Please be aware that this is not the final metadata table that will be used to analyse the data: indeed, this first table ('potential dataset') will help us evaluate the size of the potential dataset, and we can also help you prioritise the study sites that should be the most interesting for the project, so you don't have to send all of your data if this is too big for you.

Please remember that any study site from any date and any year is of interest for this project, as long as it is at least one full-night long.

Please send this table back to **charlotte.roemer1 (at) mnhn.fr** when it is filled. If you have any problem to fill the table, do not hesitate to contact us at the same address!

*Statement for data privacy: The information contained in this table will not be shared with anyone else than the coordination team of the project Bat migration routes in Europe. The information will be stored for the duration of the project. You are free to ask us to delete this information at any time.*
