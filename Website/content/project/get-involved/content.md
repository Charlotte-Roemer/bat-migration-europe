If you are interested in the project, please subscribe to the newsletter [here]({{< ref "/newsletter" >}} "Newsletter").

We are still in the process of choosing space on servers for data exchange and organising the workflow of data.

In the meantime, you can start reviewing the data that you would be willing to share for the project. We will soon distribute a participation form so you can list which data you have in your possession (basically the coordinates, date, type of material and settings). This will help us evaluate the size of the potential dataset, and we can also help you prioritise the study sites that should be the most interesting for the project, so you don't have to send all of your data if this is too big for you.

Please remember that any study site from any date and any year is of interest for this project, as long as it is at least one full-night long.
