If you are interested in the project, please subscribe to the newsletter [here]({{< ref "/newsletter" >}} "Newsletter").

We will soon distribute a participation form so you can list which data you have in your possession (basically the coordinates, date, type of material and settings). This will help us evaluate the size of the potential dataset, and we can also help you prioritise the study sites that should be the most interesting for the project, so you don't have to send all of your data if this is too big for you.
