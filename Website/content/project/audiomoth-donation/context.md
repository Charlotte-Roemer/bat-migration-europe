The project Bat migration routes in Europe is by nature a collaborative project. It needs partners all around Europe to be a success. To support bat workers and researchers from countries underfunded in bat research and conservation, EUROBATS provided a grant to the French museum of natural history for this project. This grant, along with a grant from Naturalia Environnement, allowed us to buy 196 bat recorders (AudioMoth v1.2.0, Open Acoustic Devices) that were donated to partners who wished to contribute to the study but were limited in terms of equipment. These Audiomoths became the full property of the partners.

These bat recorders were donated in exchange for sounds in WAV format, that contribute to the project Bat migration routes in Europe. We also wished to facilitate a possible long-term collaboration with the partners benefiting from this donation: the material was provided along with good practice recommendations for bat acoustic recordings and analyses.

30 selected applicants received at least one Audiomoth (up to 10) and a micro SD card of 32 Go. This map represents the number of Audiomoths distributed by country:
