title = "Bat migration routes in Europe"
+++

This project started in April 2021. Our goal is to identify spatial and temporal patterns of the presence of three common migrating bats (_Pipistrellus nathusii_, _Nyctalus noctula_ and _Nyctalus leisleri_) using acoustic datasets. 
Hotspots in acoustic activity are expected to predict priority areas for the conservation of those migrating species. One of the aims of the project is to provide operational maps to guide wind energy planning.
