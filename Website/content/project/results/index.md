<div style="text-align: justify">
These are the preliminary results for France only. 


They are based on the [Vigie-Chiro dataset](https://croemer3.wixsite.com/teamchiro/vigie-chiro). These preliminary results were produced to make a **proof of concept** of the method. This work is still ongoing and these maps should not be considered as final results.
