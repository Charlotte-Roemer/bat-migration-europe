These are the preliminary results for France only, based on the [Vigie-Chiro dataset](https://croemer3.wixsite.com/teamchiro/vigie-chiro).

These preliminary results were produced to make a **proof of concept** of the method. This work is still ongoing and these maps should not be considered as final results.
