To produce the following maps, we used Random forest modelling for confidence indexes in automatic ID >90 %. We used various descriptive variables, such as habitat type (e.g. CORINE land cover), human acivities (e.g. distance to road, to wind turbine), meteorological conditions (e.g. temperature), latitude, or longitude.
